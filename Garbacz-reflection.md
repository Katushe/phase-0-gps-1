**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?/What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

I had never actually done anything that would cause a conflict before, so it was informative to go through the process of intentionally creating one to see what happens/how to fix it. I also hadn't used fetch/merge before so it was good to see how one would get a branch from the repo instead of merging it to the master and pulling the master branch.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I wasn't quite sure what "origin" was refering to in some of the git commands, and my pair didn't know either, so I had the guide clarify whether I was right in thinking that it's just what the git system uses to refer to your remote respository instead of using the name.

**What still confuses you about git?**

I think I have a pretty good grasp of it by now, I haven't had any issues in using git with any of the other challenges.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

I had never paired before-I did GPS before any of the other pairing challenges from this week, and I think this was a good one to start with, since we had somewhere there to help out if we needed it. We were both a bit nervous to start with, but I think we relaxed more as the session went on.
