What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling a bit with some of the git commands required to push files to git prior to this session.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I got better aquainted with some of the Markdown Basics, and learned how useful GitHub can be when collaborating.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked my pair and guide to remind me of certain commands I needed to use if I could not remember them or what they did.

What still confuses you about git?
Not too much confuses me about git anymore. Most of my confusion comes from remembering commands or where I put certain files.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I think it went great. I felt like I may have been slowing my partner and guide down a bit, but they seemed very patient with me. My partner also taught me about the auto complete feature by using "tab" in the command line, which is super useful.
